# remarkable_tweaks

This describes a couple of fixes to Remarkable which aim to correct:

- **Scrolling behaviour of the live preview**. The right-hand preview panel always used to jump to the top of the document as soon as you typed any new text. 

- **Saving a styled pdf file**. This used to give errors and, if it produced a pdf file, the pictures would be missing from it.
